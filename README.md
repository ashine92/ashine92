## Hi there 👋

### About Me

I'm a passionate developer with a strong interest in **AI/ML**, **IoT/Embedded Systems**, and **Mobile App Development**. I enjoy building innovative solutions that combine hardware and software to solve real-world problems. Currently exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence and Internet of Things (AIoT) to create smart, health-focused applications.

- 🔭 I'm currently working on AI-powered health monitoring systems and smart IoT devices
- 🌱 I'm continuously learning about deep learning, embedded systems, and mobile development
- 💡 I love turning ideas into functional projects that make a difference
